# Getting Started with HyprDisplays

## Overview

HyprDisplays allows you to visually arrange your monitors, set resolutions, scales, and rotation. It saves these configurations and can automatically apply them when you connect specific monitor combinations.

## Basic Usage

1. Open **Hyprland Display Manager**.
2. Drag screens to arrange them.
3. Click a monitor to adjust scale, resolution, or rotation.
4. Click **Apply & Save**.
5. You must confirm the changes within 15 seconds, or they will revert.

## Profiles

HyprDisplays remembers the arrangement for every unique set of connected monitors.

- **Auto-apply**: If you run the daemon, plugging in a previously configured set of monitors will instantly apply your saved layout.
